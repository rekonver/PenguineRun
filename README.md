# PenguineRun

The game code is characterized by a high level of modularity, with a clear division of scripts into functional blocks (character movement, bonus system, user interface), which significantly simplifies the process of maintaining and expanding the project. It effectively integrates basic Unity mechanics, such as coroutines, events and the physics engine, as well as randomization elements to ensure dynamic gameplay; in addition, the use of PlayerPrefs for data storage contributes to increased convenience for the end user.

Not everything is perfect, and there are many things that may need modification in the future. I will refactor the code for better stability moving forward)
